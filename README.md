    - check if all possible moves for each enemy piece contains the king position

how to detect if you are in checkmate:
    A- keep track of coordinate of box drive and check whether its in possiblemoves of piece that will be moved

issues
    -fix dropping box preview in another col containing box preview

extras
    -convert possible moves to set


check:
    iterate through board and see if any pieces possible moves include kings location
    if so,break and return true

    then 
    iterate through board and see if any pieces map to possible moves of king. remove each move from kings possible 
    moves that is found. if end list is empty, checkmate, end game, else present the remainder of the list is possible moves


    in check either in player
    player will contain var holding king_loc
    call in check before turn pass in board- iterate thru board, and check if king loc is inside any piece
